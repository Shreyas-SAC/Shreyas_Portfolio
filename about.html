          <p>Hi, I am Shreyas, nice to meet you!</p>
          <p>I am a Software Developer currently living in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. I was born and brought up in Mumbai, India. I am currently building the web application for the University of Cincinnati based projects. I gathered my first experience working as a Full-Stack Developer (Intern) at the IT Solution Center at the University of Cincinnati by building a Full-Stack application with the help of all the latest technologies that served the need of universities project requirements. I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, Iâ€™m most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. Thank you so much for reading patiently about me!</p>
